## Goals

1.  Data Visualization Today
2.  Why data visualization is so important (to various fields: scientific research, journalism, education, etc.)

::: notes
1.  a recent historically significant event where visualizations played a central role
2.  and what this event reveals about the growing importance of data visualization to many different fields.

# Why Data Viz?

<!--COVID - first visualized disaster?-->

With these examples, reflect on why data visualization has become so central to both biomedical research AND public health education.

# The Outbreak of COVID-19

**QUESTION**:

How did epidemiologists, health professionals, journalists, and educators try to educate the public about how to confront COVID-19 in March 2020?

## COVID-19: Education

![COVID-19 Flatten the curve graphic](images/COVID_flatten-the-curve.jpg){fig-alt="COVID-19 Flatten the curve graphic"}

::: notes
This is now one of the most famous data visualizations in history.

Certainly the most famous and impactful in recent years.

The interesting thing: the data in this "data visualization" are not real. Rather, its based on hypothetical data.\
\
Question: do you remember when you first saw this graphic. Did you understand what it meant?

I didn't. I needed it explained - either in a news article or by a television commentator, as in this case....

## "Flatten the Curve" (2007)

2007 CDC paper, "Interim pre-pandemic planning guidance"

::: notes
The "flatten the curve" plot, however, was first designed years earlier. In 2007, the CDC created the first version of the plot in a paper outlining how to prepare for a hypothetical pandemic.

On Feb 29, 2020, Slavea Chankova of *The Economist* adapted the 2007 graphic to educate readers how to handle COVID-19 as it began to spread beyond China.

## Data Viz Lessons:

Andy Krackov (data analyst), ["Flattening the Curve and Expanding my Understanding"](https://nightingaledvs.com/flattening-the-curve-and-expanding-my-understanding/):

1.  Headlines matter
2.  Annotations are good.
3.  Know your users.
4.  Animations / drawing great.

::: notes
1.  Headlines matter. Don’t go generic when we need to tell people that they need to pay attention. Use a chart headline that helps orient the reader.
2.  Annotations are good. I mean, with flattening the curve, you don’t even need numbers. Just make sure your explanations have clear messages in easy-to-read type.
3.  Know your users. For example, many of us encounter visualizations on COVID-19 while we’re on our phones — which can make it difficult to digest what we see. Keep in mind that mobile experience.
4.  Animations are great, but if you’re in a face-to-face setting, so is drawing out the concept live on a white board or a sheet of paper.

## COVID-19: Coverage

::: notes
I remember regularly visiting the NYT COVID-19 dashboard to see whether cases were rising or falling here.

::: notes
The problem with some of these dashboards? All this data was a week or more behind. By the time cases were reported and people hospitalized, the illness. As the pandemic progressed, health scientists and data scientists collaborated to acquire and study other data that could give us more real-time updates about the spread of the pandemic, this included:

-   testing sewers (which often revealed a surge in local cases a week or two before tests did)

-   Google Trends data (an examination of Google searches for the symptoms of COVID-19 by location)

::: notes
Yet, others came up with animated and interactive visualizations to teach how COVID spreads (and, thus, the best way to slow this spread).
