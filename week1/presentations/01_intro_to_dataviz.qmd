# Introduction to Data Visualization

## Goals

1.  Data Visualization Today
2.  Myths about data visualization

::: notes
1.  the *importance* of Data Visualization Today
2.  *yet* still some myths about data visualizations remain

# Why Data Viz?

# The Outbreak of COVID-19

**QUESTION**:

How did epidemiologists, health professionals, journalists, and educators try to educate the public about how to confront COVID-19 in March 2020?

## COVID-19: Education

::: notes
This is now one of the most famous data visualizations in history.

Certainly the most famous and impactful in recent years.

The interesting thing: the data in this "data visualization" are not real. Rather, its based on hypothetical data.\
\
Question: do you remember when you first saw this graphic. Did you understand what it meant?

I didn't. I needed it explained - either in a news article or by a television commentator.

## "Flatten the Curve"

::: notes
The "flatten the curve" plot, however, was first designed years earlier. In 2007, the CDC created the first version of the plot in a paper outlining how to prepare for a hypothetical pandemic.

## Data Viz Lessons:

Andy Krackov (data analyst):

1.  Headlines matter
2.  Annotations are good.
3.  Know your users.
4.  Animations / drawing great.

::: notes
1.  Headlines matter. Don’t go generic when we need to tell people that they need to pay attention. Use a chart headline that helps orient the reader.
2.  Annotations are good. I mean, with flattening the curve, you don’t even need numbers. Just make sure your explanations have clear messages in easy-to-read type.
3.  Know your users. For example, many of us encounter visualizations on COVID-19 while we’re on our phones — which can make it difficult to digest what we see. Keep in mind that mobile experience.
4.  Animations are great, but if you’re in a face-to-face setting, so is
    drawing out the concept live on a white board or a sheet of paper.

# Data Viz: The Practice

<!--the practice of data visualization-->

1.  Begin with data and a question
2.  Many of the best visualizations start with pencil, paper, and an idea
3.  Conduct **exploratory data analysis & visualization** to explore hidden patterns in your data
4.  Perform other types of analysis (statistical, textual, qualitative, etc.)
5.  Prepare visualizations to help you convey your findings (and to allow others to explore the data)
    1.  think about what visual variables (location, color, size, shape, transparency, etc.) best represent your data variables.
    2.  consider your purpose (are you trying to persuade? or let the viewer come to their own conclusions?)
    3.  consider your audience
