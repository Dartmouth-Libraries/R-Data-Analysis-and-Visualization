# Data Viz: The Practice

<!--the practice of data visualization-->

1.  Begin with data and a question
2.  Many of the best visualizations start with pencil, paper, and an idea
3.  Conduct **exploratory data analysis & visualization** to explore hidden patterns in your data
4.  Perform other types of analysis (statistical, textual, qualitative, etc.)
5.  Prepare visualizations to help you convey your findings (and to allow others to explore the data)
    1.  think about what visual variables (location, color, size, shape, transparency, etc.) best represent your data variables.
    2.  consider your purpose (are you trying to persuade? or let the viewer come to their own conclusions?)
    3.  consider your audience
