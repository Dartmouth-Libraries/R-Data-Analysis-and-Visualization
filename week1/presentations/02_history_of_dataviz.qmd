# History of Data Visualization

## Goals

## "Flatten the Curve": First Visualized Global Crisis

![COVID-19 Flatten the Curve graphic](images/COVID_flatten-the-curve-01.jpg){fig-alt="two area graphs: one steep showing the impacts of COVID-19 if not precautionary measures are taken and the other, with a flatter slope, showing how following pre-cautionary measures will prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed."}

# Origins of Modern Data Visualization

## Pre-Modern Maps

## A Scottish Scoundrel & Spy (and Data Viz Innovator)

## First Line Plot? (1786)

![William Playfair published perhaps the world's first "statistical graphic" in his \*Commercial and Political Atlas\*, which was printed in 1786.](images/Playfair_TimeSeries-2.png){fig-alt="Line chart and time-series graphic where the x axis represents years between 1700 and 1780 and the y axis represents number of exports / imports in thousands. Shows two lines, the number imports from and the number of exports to Denmark and Norway."}

## First Bar Chart? (1786)

![William Playfair's bar chart showing exports and imports to ad from Scotland, 1781. Experts have argued this is the world's first bar plot.](images/Playfair_1781_first-bar-chart.jpg){fig-alt="Bar plot comparing imports/exports to/from Scotland by various countries and territories (including Ireland, Greenland, the United States, the West Indies, and Russia)."}

## First Pie Chart? (1801)

![Playfair also apparently created the world's first pie chart in 1801, published with his "Statistical Breviary".](images/Playfair-piechart.jpg)

## First Ridgeline Plot?
