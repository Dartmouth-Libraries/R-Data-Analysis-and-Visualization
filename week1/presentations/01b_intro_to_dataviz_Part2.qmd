<!--CLIMATE CHANGE - hockey stick graphic-->

![The iconic "hockey stick" graph that became the focus of intense climate debate. First published by Michael Mann, Raymond S. Bradley, and Malcolm Hughes in "Northern hemisphere temperatures during the past millennium: Inferences, uncertainties, and limitations," Geophysical Research Letters (1999). It achieved a wider audience with its publication in a 2001 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations.](https://psu-gatsby-files-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/hockeystick.gif)

::: notes
The coronavirus pandemic may have been "The first visualized global crisis in history". However, visualizations had played a role in helping us understand other crises of the past and present. Climate scientists produced this now-classic line graph in 1998 at a time when few in the public were paying attention to the imminent threat of climate change at a global scale.

Note: lacking temperature readings for most of human history before the 19th century, the scientists had to estimate pre-modern historical climate variation using different types of "proxy" data (tree rings, corals, ice cores, and historical records like shipping logs).

The Hockey Stick achieved greater prominence after a 2001 UN report on climate change included this graph. It quickly became a central symbol of the "climate wars.

::: notes
The release of this graph and new climate science research provoked a backlash from the fossil fuels industry and other corporations that felt threatened by the implications of this research. One of the creators of this graphic wrote a book about the subsequent turmoil.

# Data Viz: The Practice

<!--the practice of data visualization-->

1.  Begin with data and a question
2.  Many of the best visualizations start with pencil, paper, and an idea
3.  Conduct **exploratory data analysis & visualization** to explore hidden patterns in your data
4.  Perform other types of analysis (statistical, textual, qualitative, etc.)
5.  Prepare visualizations to help you convey your findings (and to allow others to explore the data)
    1.  think about what visual variables (location, color, size, shape, transparency, etc.) best represent your data variables.
    2.  consider your purpose (are you trying to persuade? or let the viewer come to their own conclusions?)
    3.  consider your audience
