Berry Classroom 180a ("The LINK")

# Lesson 1: Intro to R / R Studio

# Lesson 2: Intro to Data Wrangling (tidyverse / dplyr)

## dplyr / tidyverse verbs for data wrangling  {.scrollable}

To modify and "wrangle" datasets, the tidyverse commonly uses the following verbs / functions:

-   **select()**: to select specific columns by their names or data types

-   **arrange()**: to order rows by one or more columns

-   **rename()**: to rename columns

-   **mutate()**: to create columns

-   **filter()**: to filter out rows by a given condition

-   **distinct()**: to keep only distinct / unique rows

-   **gather()**: to make "wide" data longer

-   **spread()**: to make "long" data wider

-   **separate()**: to split a single column into multiple columns

-   **unite()**: to combine multiple columns into one
