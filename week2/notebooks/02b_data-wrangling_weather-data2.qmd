# Data Wrangling for Visualization, Weather Data Part 2

In the previous notebook, you learned how to subset and re-shape a large dataset to create a simple line graph showing changes in yearly max and min temperatures for Hanover, NH. If nothing else, the results clearly show steadily warming local temperatures.

However, the advanced capabilities of computational graphics mean that we can represent data trends in far higher resolution.

In this notebook, we will visualize temperature fluctuations at the daily rather than yearly level.

# 1. Setup

## 1.1 Import necessary packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


```

## 1.2 Import Data

```{r}
df <- read.csv("../data/Hanover_weather-data_1884-2025.csv")

```

# 2. Planning

```         







```

## 5. Visualizing

# EXERCISE:

Create a similar graph, but this time showing the average yearly rain and snowfall for Hanover.
