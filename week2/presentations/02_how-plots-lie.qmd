# Interactive Review

Review the following 5 sets of data visualizations. For each:

1.  Identify how it may be misleading. What choices did the creator of the visualization make that may mislead the viewer?
2.  Propose a solution: what can be changed about this graphic to make it more truthful?

# Example 1: Temperature Graphs

![A Climate chart posted by the *National Review* in 2015.](images/PDF16.NationalReviewTemperatures.svg)

::: notes
### Problem?

While technically correct in the sense that the data on the x and y axes are accurate; this is extremely misleading. As a response in the *Washington Post* points out, the scale of the graphic, "intentionally hides the actual change in the temperatures. Its akin to suggesting that Shaquille O'Neal and Mini-Me are the same height because they're both tiny compared to the planet Jupiter."

## Problem

-   use of misleading axis extents

## Solution

-   line graphs are intended to show change over time.

    -   Choose meaningful y axis extents (i.e. historical maximum and minimum levels)

    -   Choose a meaningful time range (x axis)

### Problem?

## Solution

-   Need to normalize numbers

    -   by proportion of total (population, number of theaters, etc.)

    -   adjust for inflation
