# Basic T Test in R 

In the field of Statistics, a "T" test can be used to compare the means of two datasets. Because R was **built as a statistical language**, the [t.test](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/t.test.html ""T" test in R") function in the standard/base-R installation using the [stats](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html "stats") package.

## 1. Data

### *Load sample data* 

The [mtcars](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_stat_data_set.asp "R statistics sample dataset mtcars") dataset is a good one to use here.

```{r}
# Load the 'dplyr' library (data pliers) 
library(dplyr)

# Load dataset
data(mtcars)

# Conduct t-test on mpg (miles per gallon) for cars with automatic and manual transmission.
automatic_cars <- mtcars %>% filter(am == 1)
manual_cars    <- mtcars %>% filter(am == 0)
head(automatic_cars)
head(manual_cars)

```

```{r}

# Compute descriptive statistics and summarize data for each group
autosummary <- automatic_cars %>%
  group_by(am) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(mpg),
            sd     = sd(mpg),
            min    = min(mpg),
            max    = max(mpg))
manusummary  <- manual_cars %>%
  group_by(am) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(mpg),
            sd     = sd(mpg),
            min    = min(mpg),
            max    = max(mpg))

# View descriptive statistics for both groups
autosummary
manusummary
```

```{r}
# Conduct t-test on mpg for the two groups
# t test is a statistical test used to compare the means of two groups
ttest_result <- t.test(automatic_cars$mpg, manual_cars$mpg)

# Interpret t-test results
cat(' t-test statistic :', ttest_result$statistic, ' ')
#cat('degrees of freedom:', ttest_result$
cat('p-value :', ttest_result$p.val)
if (ttest_result$p.val < 0.05){
  cat(" Conclusion: because the p.val is less than 0.05 when we compare the means with the t.test functino, there very likely IS a significant difference in mean mpg between cars with automatic and manual transmission, the low p-value tells us that the null hypothesis, that the means were equal, is false (Reject H0 the null hypothesis)")
} else {
  cat(" Fail to reject H0, no significant difference in mean mpg between cars with automatic and manual transmission.")
}

# ("Reject H0, there is a significant difference in mean mpg between cars with automatic and manual transmission")
```

```{r}

##### NOTE: copy this out of qmd notebook, paste in to an "R" script for proper display in R studio 

# Load the dataset
data(mtcars)

# am  (automatic or manual) 
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am, labels = c("Automatic", "Manual"))

# set up plot area 
par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # Adjust rows and columns as needed

# boxplot, miles per gallon (by transmission type auto or manual)
boxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, main = "MPG by Transmission Type", 
        xlab = "Transmission Type", ylab = "Miles per Gallon", 
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"))

# boxplot for hp (horsepower)
boxplot(hp ~ am, data = mtcars, main = "Horsepower by Transmission Type", 
        xlab = "Transmission Type", ylab = "Horsepower", 
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"))

# boxplot vehicle wt (weight)
boxplot(wt ~ am, data = mtcars, main = "Weight by Transmission Type", 
        xlab = "Transmission Type", ylab = "Weight", 
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"))

# boxplot for track time over 1/4 mile (qsec)
boxplot(qsec ~ am, data = mtcars, main = "1/4 Mile Time by Transmission Type", 
        xlab = "Transmission Type", ylab = "1/4 Mile Time", 
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"))
```
