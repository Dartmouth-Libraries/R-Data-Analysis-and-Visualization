## R and the Swirlstats library

R and the **SwirlStats** library, see [SwirlStats](https://swirlstats.com/ "SwirlStats"){.uri}.

# T-test to compare MPG for cars with 4 and 6 cylinders
t_test_result <- t.test(mpg ~ as.factor(cyl), data = mtcars[mtcars$cyl %in% c(4, 6), ])
print(t_test_result)
# 2. T-Test (For the mtcars dataset)
#A t-test compares the means of two groups (e.g., cars with 4 cylinders vs. cars with 6 cylinders). The null hypothesis is that the means are equal.
# Welch Two Sample t-test

#data:  mpg by as.factor(cyl)
#t = 4.7191, df = 12.956, p-value = 0.0004048
#alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 4 and group 6 is not equal to 0
#95 percent confidence interval:
#  3.751376 10.090182
#sample estimates:
#  mean in group 4 mean in group 6 
#26.66364        19.74286 
# Thus, the test shows that it is likely that mean mpg of 4cyl is different than the mean mpg of 6 cyl


# Convert cyl (cylinders) and am (transmission: 0 = automatic, 1 = manual) to factors
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am)

# Create a contingency table
contingency_table <- table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$am)
print(contingency_table)

# Perform chi-square test
chi_square_result <- chisq.test(contingency_table)
print(chi_square_result)
# 3. Chi-Square Test (For the mtcars dataset)
# A chi-square test checks if there is a relationship between two categorical variables (e.g., number of cylinders and transmission type).

# Explanation of Results:
#Summary statistics: Provides an overview of each variable (e.g., mean, median, min, max).
#Visualizations: Boxplots and scatter plots help visualize the distribution and relationships between variables.
#T-Test: Tests whether the mean MPG of cars with 4 vs. 6 cylinders differs significantly.
#Chi-Square Test: Tests whether there's a significant relationship between the number of cylinders and transmission type.
#This code covers key EDA techniques, a basic t-test, and a chi-square test, making it ideal for an introductory R workshop.
